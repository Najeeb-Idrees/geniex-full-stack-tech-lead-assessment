# Tech Lead Assessment: WorkLog Settlement System

## Overview

You have been handed a **fullstack WorkLog settlement system** built by a junior developer. The system is composed of **10 files** in the `candidate/` directory — a TypeScript backend (Express + PostgreSQL) and a React frontend.

The system's goal is to:

- Track freelancer work via **WorkLogs** containing **TimeSegments** (independently recorded periods of work, each with hours and a rate)
- Apply **Adjustments** (deductions or bonuses) to WorkLogs
- Run a **settlement** that calculates how much each freelancer is owed and creates a **Remittance** (a single payout per user)
- Provide an admin-facing **Settlement Review** screen where an admin can inspect open worklogs and their amounts before confirming a settlement
- Handle **post-settlement changes**: new segments can be added to previously settled WorkLogs, reopening them for the next settlement cycle

Your task is to answer the questions stated below in the deliverables section.

**You do not need to run the code to complete this assessment.** All questions can be answered by reading the provided files and tracing the logic. The seed data in `seed.ts` shows you exactly what is in the database.
